## üî¨ Experience

### Security Researcher

As a security researcher, I actively investigate and report security vulnerabilities. A notable achievement includes the responsible disclosure of a critical vulnerability in Miniclip's "8 Ball Pool" game in January 2024. The vulnerability could have allowed for unlimited in-game item claims and has since been patched by the Miniclip team. My work demonstrates a commitment to improving the security posture of popular applications.
